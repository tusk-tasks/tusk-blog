#### uWork is a community platform that connects people looking for help, with students looking for work.
We have been creating uWork for eight months now and are only a few months away from launch. We know we have made a great product and can’t wait to share it with you all!

Everyday, there are things that we all need to do that we would much rather not: clearing the garden, taking rubbish to the dump, cleaning up after a party or picking something up from the shops… the list goes on. Sometimes, there is simply no way to escape these tasks.

We were surprised that there wasn’t a platform that people could use to find help with everyday tasks. As students, we also know how difficult it can be to find work while studying at university and how at times, earning extra money can be essential.

uWork will be a flexible and affordable way to outsource tasks while helping students earn money. If you are interested in keeping up to date with our progress, sign up at uwork.co.uk.

See you soon,

The uWork team
