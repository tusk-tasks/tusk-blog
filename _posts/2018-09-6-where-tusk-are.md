#### We are seeing Tusk being used to complete so many awesome tasks 😍

Recently we have seen a lots of gardening and removal tasks completed by some awesome students 💪 There were also some of the more quirky ones like labelling jam jars and cleaning an Airbnb home before a new guest arrives.

Bit by bit we are making Tusk available in more places and so far you can list a task in any of these places:

#### Oxford
#### Winchester
#### Southampton
#### Egham, Virgina Water, and Englefield Green

Over the coming year we hope to continue to grow to more cities across the UK 💯

So get [listing](https://tusktasks.io/listings/new) and [tasking](https://tusktasks.io/listings?q=South%2C+England%2C+UK). We promise you'll love it! 😋
