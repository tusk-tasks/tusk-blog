### Happy Christmas Tuskers.

The merry festive period is finally upon us, full of joy, good-tidings and, unfortunately, a lot of **waste**.

In the UK, 30% more waste is generated during the month of December. This equates to about 3 million tonnes, with the majority being sent to landfills, creating more methane and more CO2 (which we don’t like).

So, what are we throwing away?

* 83 square kilometres of **wrapping paper** and 125,000 tonnes of **plastic**
* 1 billion **Christmas cards** (the equivalent of 33 million trees)
* 6 million **Christmas trees**
* 54 million platefuls of **food**, including 2 million Turkeys
* 13,350 tonnes of **glass bottles** (If this was all recycled it could save 4,200 tonnes of CO2 – the same as taking 1,300 cars off the road)
* And £42 million worth of Christmas **presents**

Almost all of us wish for a greener, cleaner planet, but how can we put this into practice? Here are our Tusk tips to work towards a greener Christmas this year:

* **Recycle, recycle, recycle -** 70% of our waste (including the Christmas tree) can be recycled so please remember to do so
* Send **E-cards**
* **It’s OK to regift!** Use second hand marketplaces like eBay and Depop to rehome unwanted presents

So, we wish you a wonderful, sustainable Christmas and we look forward to seeing you in 2020, the year of tasks!
