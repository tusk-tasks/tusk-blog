#### **Not sure how much to pay for your task? Here’s a little help.**

On Tusk you can complete almost any task and set any price you like. But, if you need a bit of guidance, here are some of our more common tasks and the recommended pay (per hour) for each:

Flyering **£12**

Event Staff **£12**

Tutoring **£17**

Furniture Assembly **£14**

Office Admin **£12**

Dog Walking/Sitting **£12**

Gardening **£14**

Cleaning **£12**

Handyman **£14**

Delivery/Removal **£14**

Moving/Heavy Lifting **£14**

Research **£12**

Design/Photography **£17**

Translations **£15**

Tech Help **£12**

Our prices are based on the National Minimum Wage (£8.21 per hour), the London Living Wage (£10.55 per hour), the rate for the rest of the UK (£9.00 per hour) and also take into account the Tusk Service Fee of 15%.

We hope this helps and please don’t worry too much - once you have listed your task, you will receive offers from the students, so the fair price of the task will quickly become apparent.
